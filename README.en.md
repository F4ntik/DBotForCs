# DBotForCs

## Project Purpose

DBotForCs is a Discord bot designed to interact with a Counter-Strike server. It likely provides functionalities such as server monitoring, player statistics, RCON command execution, and other administrative or user-oriented features for managing and engaging with a CS server community through Discord.

The bot's architecture suggests components for direct Counter-Strike server interaction (`dbot/src/cs_server/cs_server.py`), Discord bot functionalities (`dbot/src/bot/bot_server.py`), and potentially a web interface or API (`dbot/src/webserver/web_server.py`).

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install cachetools redis discord aiohttp aiomysql
```

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, execute the main application script. Assuming `dbot/src/app.py` is the entry point:

```bash
python -m dbot.src.app
```

**Note:** You may need to configure environment variables or create a configuration file. A configuration file appears to be available at `dbot/src/config.py`. Please refer to this file or related documentation for specific configuration requirements (e.g., Discord bot token, CS server details, database credentials).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   `dbot/src/`: Contains the core source code for the bot and its various components (Discord bot, CS server interface, web server, data handling, etc.).
*   `dbot/docs/`: Includes documentation files for different modules and components of the project.
*   `dbot/tests/`: Contains tests for ensuring the functionality and reliability of the bot.
*   `README.en.md`: This file (English version of the main README).
*   `README.ru.md`: Russian version of the main README.
